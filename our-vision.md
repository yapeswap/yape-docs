# Project Vision

**Our Mission** is to build novel AMM features that provide liquidity providers with opportunities to earn yield on their assets in the most capitally efficient ways possible.

**Our Vision** is that our application will be governed by and for the members of the DAO and the users of the protocol, and that we can reach a point of runoff development, where the core team is no longer needed to make decisions and foster development.

**To achieve our Mission and Vision**, we will work to ship new features as often as possible while fostering the growth of the DAO and community and finding opportunities for collaboration with other strong web3 teams and communities.
