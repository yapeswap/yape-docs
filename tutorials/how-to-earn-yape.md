# How to Earn YAPE

There are three ways to earn $YAPE. The first is by providing liquidity to Yapeswap pools - see 'How to Supply Liquidity'.  The second way to earn $YAPE is by locking it for $veYAPE and collecting the $YAPE dividends that come from being a $veYAPE holder. The final way to earn $YAPE is by burning $cYAPE. 

$cYAPE is a stablecoin pegged to $DAI, whose main intended function is to pay workers for their contributions to the Yapeswap DAO. When workers are paid in $cYAPE, they can swap it out for $DAI, effectively cashing their paycheck, or they can burn it to mine $YAPE rewards. The burnt $cYAPE accrues $YAPE rewards and does so at an APY higher than the rest of the $YAPE mining pools. To acquire $cYAPE without being paid for a contribution, one can buy it at a premium rate of $2 DAI to 1 $cYAPE. Some users elect to buy $cYAPE in order to take advantage of the high APY of the burn mining pool.
