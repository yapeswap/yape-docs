# Governance

The Yapeswap DAO is governed by the voices and opinions of $veYAPE holders, referred to colloquially as Yapes. In the Yapeswap DAO forum, Yapes can discuss new governance proposals, vote, and receive fair rewards for their contributions.

If you are a $veYAPE holder, you are a Yape, and you can exercise your right by following the guide below.

## Discuss with Community

Join the Yapeswap [Discord](https://discord.gg/xpMkdAKxff) and [Forum](https://forum.yape.exchange/) now and share your voices.

## Vote to proposals

* All proposals must be discussed in the [Forum](https://forum.yape.exchange/) and get at least **5 likes** before voting
* The minimum threshold to submit governance proposals is **100 $veYAPE**.
* Quorum for governance proposals is set to **100k $veYAPE**.
* After voting ends, all successful proposals have an enforced 1 day grace period \(by the Timelock contract\).

### Voting Rule

#### Off-chain \(Snapshot\)

* Used when gas fees are high.
* After a proposal is announced, there is a 48 hour pre-election period before voting starts.
* $veYAPE holders can then cast votes within a 48 hour voting window.

#### On-chain

* Used when gas fees are low.
* After a proposal is announced, there is a 7 day pre-election period before voting starts.
* $veYAPE holders can then cast votes within a 7 day voting window.
* $veYAPE holders can use on-chain voting to decide not to use Snapshot.

## Receive Dividends

$veYAPE holders can claim their dividends streamed from the Yapeswap protocol. All protocol fees \(0.15% of swap fee\) and yields from Yearn vaults will be used to buy back $YAPE. All $YAPE bought back will be distributed to $veYAPE holders.
