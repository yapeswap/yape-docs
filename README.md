# Introduction

Yapeswap is an Automated Market Maker \(AMM\) on the Ethereum blockchain that enables liquidity providers to earn additional yield by investing idle token reserves from liquidity pools into yield farming and aggregator services hosted by Yearn Finance. The protocol is maintained by independent developers and governed by veYAPE holders.

### Automated Market Maker

An AMM is a decentralized trading pool that enables market participants to buy and sell various currencies. The liquidity providers \(LPs\) that fund these trading pools are incentivized by rewards to fund the pool. The greater the trading volume relative to the size of the pool, the greater rewards the LP's stand to generate.

### Yearn Finance Vaults

Yearn Finance is a suite of products in Decentralized Finance \(DeFi\) that provides lending aggregation, yield generation, and insurance on the Ethereum blockchain. Their Vaults are capital pools that automatically generate yield based on opportunities present in the market. Vaults benefit users by socializing gas costs, automating the yield generation and rebalancing process, and automatically shifting capital as opportunities arise.
