Once connected, you can swap tokens you have in your wallet on the ‘Swap’ tab, acquire LP tokens from the ‘Pool’ tab, and manage your pool positions from the DAO page. You’ll also be able to lock $YAPE for $veYAPE or burn mine with any $cYAPE you’ve received from contributing to the protocol.

If you do not have a decentralized wallet, you will not be able to connect to the Yapeswap dapp.

Please refer to the following guide for more information on how to create a MetaMask wallet.
